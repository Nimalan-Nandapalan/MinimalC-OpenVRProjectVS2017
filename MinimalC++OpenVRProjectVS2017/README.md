Minimal C++ OpenVR Project VS2017
---

This is a minimal Visual Studio 2017 solution/project using straight MSVC and OpenVR. 
This was done as a learning experiment as I'm new to the following scenes: Open Source/FOSS, Windwows Development, VR Development.

### License

I've included the OpenVR LICENSE as I think I'm meant to. 

Blah blah copyright you can use this for any legal use.

All constructive suggestions are welcome.
